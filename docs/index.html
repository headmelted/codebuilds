<h1 id="testing"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>&nbsp;Testing</h1>
<p>For each and every release, the build system prepares a virtual system for the given architecture. The finished package is then installed and tested with the full suite of tests from Microsoft. Once this is done, a test report is prepared that can be downloaded for review.  Only packages that pass all tests will proceed to release.</p>

<i>(including Raspberry Pis, Odroids and other single-board computers)</i>

<p>Packages are currently available in DEB and RPM format for ARM, x86 and amd64 systems.</p>

<p>You can use the scripts here to install the packages and add their repository to your system.</p>

<p>Open a new terminal. If you need super-user rights (you probably do), then you can enter <strong>sudo -s</strong> and press return
to enter a super-user session. Run the installer for your current distribution:</p>

<h3 id="header-apt"><img src="images/debian-logo.png" width="18" height="18">&nbsp;APT instructions</h3>
<i>(including Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint)</i>

<pre id="install-apt">. <( wget -O - https://codebuilds.org/installers/apt.sh )</pre>

<h3 id="header-yum"><img src="images/rpm-logo.png" width="18" height="18">&nbsp;YUM instructions</h3>
<i>(including Fedora, Pidora, Red Hat and SUSE)</i>

<pre id="install-yum">. <( wget -O - https://codebuilds.org/installers/yum.sh )</pre>

<p>Press the return key.  Once the installer has completed, you should have a "Code - OSS" entry in your desktop program list.</p>

<h3 id="linux-header-manual">Manual installation</h1>

<p>If for any reason the script above will not work on your system, or you do not want to add the package source
for updates, you can get the latest version of the package for your system below.</p>

<h4 id="header-gpg"><img src="images/gpg-logo.png" width="18" height="18">&nbsp;Public GPG key</h3>

<p>For either APT or YUM installation, you'll want the public GPG key to verify the package, which you can download <a href="https://bintray.com/user/downloadSubjectPublicKey?username=headmelted">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="header-apt">APT and YUM packages</h3>

<p>These packages are now available directly from <a href="https://github.com/headmelted/codebuilds/releases">the releases page</a>.</p>

<section class="callout callout-faq">
<div class="callout-content">
<h1 id="faq"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>&nbsp;Frequently asked questions</h1>

<dl>
  
<dt>What is this?</dt>
<dd>These are automated builds of the open-source edition of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.</dd>

<dt>How does this work?</dt>
<dd>The latest code is pulled on a nightly basis from Microsoft's <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode">official repository</a>. If there are updates, the code is built, tested, packaged and deployed.</dd>

<dt>Which devices are supported?</dt>
<dd>Please refer to the <a href="#platforms">Platforms</a> section.</dd>

<dt>Do these releases support extensions?</dt>
<dd>The extensions you want <strong>should</strong> work.  Any dependencies that are not local to your architecture (e.g. x86 binary code on an ARM chromebook) will be emulated to ensure compatibility, but there is not guarantee of compatibility.</dd>

<dt>Can I really run Visual Studio Code on my phone?</dt>
<dd>You may be able to run it, but it won't do much unless you have a physical keyboard. The Android instructions are really intended for convertible tablets and docked handsets.</dd>

<dt>Do I need to "root" my Android device?</dt>
<dd>Absolutely not, and there are good security reasons not to.</dd>

<dt>Do I need to put my Chromebook into Developer Mode?</dt>
<dd>Only if your Chromebook does not currently have Android support, although performance and usability will be better if going down the developer mode route (it uses Crouton rather than Android). There are good security reasons not to enable Developer Mode, so consider this trade-off carefully.</dd>

<dt>Will Visual Studio Code run on my device?</dt>
<dd>The best way to find out if your device is compatible is to go to the <a href="#instructions">Instructions</a> section and try it for yourself.</dd>

<dt>Which virtual systems are these releases tested on?</dt>
<dd>
  <dl>
    <dt>32-bit ARM hard-float (armhf)</dt>
    <dd>These packages are installed and tested on a virtualized Raspberry Pi 2 running Raspbian Jessie.</dd>
    <dt>64-bit ARM hard-float (arm64)</dt>
    <dd>These packages are tested on a modified Ubuntu 16.04 image to mimic an Odroid C2.</dd>
  </dl>
</dd>

<dt>You emulate the whole Raspberry Pi?</dt>
<dd>Absolutely, it's the only way to be sure that all of the dependencies are tested and supported for a given build. (Note that x86 emulation is also disabled for this, to make sure we aren't accidentally cheating).</dd>

<dt>Are these releases provided by Microsoft?</dt>
<dd><strong>No</strong>. These releases are an independent community effort. For clarity, this website (and the releases here) are <strong>not</strong> affiliated with Microsoft.</dd>

<dt>Are you a Microsoft employee (or MVP)?</dt>
<dd>I am not. (Unfortunately not, but you can <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/Nomination/nominate-an-mvp">nominate me</a>).</dd>

<dt>Why is the logo so much different from the one on Microsoft's website?</dt>
<dd>The Visual Studio Code logo is owned by Microsoft, and is reserved for use on releases provided directly by them, so cannot be used here.  I also do not want to mislead anyone into believing that these builds are provided by or officially endorsed by Microsoft directly (see question and answer above).</dd>

<dt>Where are the packages being hosted?</dt>
<dd>The release packages are hosted on Github Releases and by JFrog Bintray, both of whom are graciously providing this service for free under their open-source plans.</dd>

<dt>Why make these builds?</dt>
<dd>The intention of these builds is to get Visual Studio Code into the hands of as many developers (and aspiring developers) as possible.  Doing this means reaching out to those users on the most cost-conscious machines, and therefore supporting lower-end devices based on ARM that may be more complicated for Microsoft to support in an official capacity.</dd>

<dt>Why Visual Studio Code?</dt>
<dd>I personally wanted to use the tool on my own ARM single-board computers for teaching purposes, and on my Chromebook, so this is really a case of "scratch your own itch" software.</dd>

<dt>This is really cool. Can I help with this?</dt>
<dd>Yes you can! Any and all help is appreciated, but you'll need to digitally sign the <a href="https://cla.microsoft.com/">Microsoft CLA</a> first, so that we can contribute any fixes back upstream to the core repository.</dd>

<dt>I've found a bug, where can I raise it?</dt>
<dd>Bugs can be raised directly in Github at the issues page, but please ensure the bug is related to the installation on ARM and/or Chromebooks as per these scripts.  Issues with the core product should be raised at Microsoft's official repository, so that they'll be fixed in the core (the fixes will propagate to these builds).</dd>

<dt>So who maintains this site?</dt>
<dd>I'm Jay. Nice to meet you. You can find my details in the <a href="#contact-me">contact section</a>.</dd>
