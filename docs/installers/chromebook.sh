This tool will guide you through setting up your Chromebook for Visual Studio Code.

Code requires a Linux environment to run, so we'll need to install a Ubuntu 14.04
(Trusty Tahr) environment first. Then we'll install git, and some helpers to make
using Code as smooth as possible on your Chromebook, including a launch helper that
will start Code in it's own window 'code'.

During the installation of the Linux chroot, crouton will ask several questions to
ensure you are aware of the changes it is making.

PLEASE READ ALL OF THE QUESTIONS YOU ARE ASKED CAREFULLY BEFORE ANSWERING.
